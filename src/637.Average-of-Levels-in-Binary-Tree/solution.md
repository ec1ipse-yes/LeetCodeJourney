### URL

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree/

### Description

Given the root of a binary, return the average values of nodes on each level in the form of an array.

#### constrains:

- Whether the binary tree is all not empty
- The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4]
- -2^31 <= Node.Val <= 2^31 - 1

### Solution

1. DFS(with recursion)
2. BFS(with stack)

### Implementation

- [X] [Golang](./solution.go)
- [X] [Cpp](./solution.cpp)
